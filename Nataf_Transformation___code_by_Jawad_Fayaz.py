This code performs Nataf transfomation of two correlated random variables by
approximating their correlation in the standard normal domain (y-space) using 
their marginal distributions and correlation in orginal domain. This code is 
based on the polynomial approximation developed by (Liu and Der Kiureghian, 1986)
described in Appendix B.2 of Melchers (2002)- "Structural Reliability Analysis and Prediction" 


Notations for Marginal Distributions (bother lower and uppercase allowed):
        Normal                                 - 'N'
        Uniform                                - 'U'
        Shifted Exponential                    - 'SE'
        Shifted Rayleigh                       - 'SR'
        Extreme Value I Largest (Gumbel)       - 'G'
        Lognormal                              - 'LN'
        Gamma                                  - 'GM'
        Extreme Value III Smallest (Weibull)   - 'W' 

Note: All combinations of these marginal distributions are not available (Check Melchers 2002)
